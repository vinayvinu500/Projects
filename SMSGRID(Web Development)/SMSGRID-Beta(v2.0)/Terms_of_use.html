        to the assigned entity. We are not responsible for the final delivery of the message, as this is out of our

        lifespan allocated to them, either by us or a Mobile Network Operator will be discarded by the Mobile Network
        Operator, without any notice. We are not liable for any loss incurred by the failure of a message to be
        delivered and you acknowledge that damages concerning financial or other loss resulting from delivery failure
        cannot be claimed from Team SmsGrid. Furthermore, you agree that the message contents are deemed to have zero
        value. You also acknowledge that text-messages are transmitted unencrypted and that eavesdropping of mobile
        phone communications, including SMS delivery by third parties is possible. We also recommend that you ensure
