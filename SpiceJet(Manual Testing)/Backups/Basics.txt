What is Test Case Detail
	Equivalence Class Partioning
		1. To validate valid length of input between lower & upper bounds
		2. To validate invalid length of input less than lowerbound
		3. To validate invalid length of input larger than upperbound

	Functionality Testing
		1. To validate valid input with only alphabets
		2. To validate invalid input of special characters and numbers 
		3. To validate invalid  null value

	GUI Testing
		1. To validate the title of the form
	
	Usability Testing
		1.Check whether user has entered correct url. 
		2. Check whether the given url works in other web   browsers.                                                                                    
		3. Check whether the page content has any  incorrect spelling or grammatical errors.                                                                                   
		4.Check whether all fonts are same as per the requirement.                                                                    
		5.Check whether all the fields are correctly aligned.                                          
		 6. Check whether enough space is provided between field labels,rows and columns.                                                                                                       
		7. Check whether all buttons are in a standard format and size.  


Types of Testing
	- GUI Testing
	- Usability Testing
	- Functionality Testing
	- Equivalence Class Partioning
	- Boundary Value Analysis	

What is Functionality Testing
	Testing in which functionalities of a software are tested by giving different inputs
	- Identifying how a functionality is expected to behave
	- Creating input data to check the functionality (Based on requirements)
	- Executing the prepared test cases
	- Comparing actual results with the expected results

	Name 
		- should be alphabets
		- Should be a valid email format
		- doesn't contain special characters
		- doesn't contain null value

What is Equivalence Class Partioning 
	It is a test design technique
	It is Divided input test data into partitions
	It is used in unit-testing in white box testing
	It is used in system testing in black box testing
	It saves time because to pick up one value from each partition, whether the system accepts it or not

	Invalid Partition	=> Min - 1			=> Should reject the value
	Valid Partition          => In between the range inclusive	=> Should accept the value
	Invalid Partition	=> Max + 1			=> Should reject the value

	Date => 1 - 31
	Invalid partition	=> Min - 1
		0, -1, -2, -3,....
	Valid Partition          => In between the range inclusive
		1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ....., 30, 31
	Invalid Partition	=> Max + 1
		32, 33, 34,......

	Username => 6 to 10 characters
	Invalid Partition	=> Min - 1
		0 character, 1 character, ......, 5 character
	Valid Partition          => In between the range inclusive
		6 character, 7 character, ......., 10 character
	Invalid Partition	=> Max + 1
		11 character, 12 character, ............
	
	Age => 18 to 80 years except 60 to 65 years
	Invalid partition	=> Min - 1
		....., 0 year, 1 year, ........., 17 years
	Valid Partition          => In between the range inclusive
		18, 19, .............., 59 years
	Invalid partition	=> Min - 1
		60, 61, 62, 63, 64 ,65 years
	Valid Partition          => In between the range inclusive
		66, 67, ....., 79, 80 years
	Invalid Partition	=> Max + 1
		81, 82, ......................
	
	
What is Boundary Value Analysis
	It is a test design technique
	Related to Equivalence Class Partitioning
	Test Both sides(upper bound, lower bound) 

	Date => 1  - 31
	Invalid Partition - valid partition lower boundary
		Boundary value just below the boundary => 0 (reject by the system)
		Boundary value just above the boundary => 1 (accept by the system)

	Invalid Partition - valid partition upper boundary
		Boundary value just below the boundary => 31 (accept by the system)
		Boundary value just above the boundary => 32 (reject by the system)

	Username => 6 to 10 characters
	Invalid Partition - valid partition lower boundary
		Boundary value just below the boundary => 5 characters (reject by the system)
		Boundary value just above the boundary => 6 characters (accept by the system)

	Invalid Partition - valid partition upper boundary
		Boundary value just below the boundary => 10 characters (accept by the system)
		Boundary value just above the boundary => 11 characters (reject by the system)

	Floating Point Values => 0.2 - 0.8
	Invalid Partition - valid partition lower boundary
		Boundary value just below the boundary => 0.1 (reject by the system)
		Boundary value just above the boundary => 0.2 characters (accept by the system)

	Invalid Partition - valid partition upper boundary
		Boundary value just below the boundary => 0.8 (accept by the system)
		Boundary value just above the boundary => 0.9 (reject by the system)
	

What is Expected Results
	Should save the data in database
	System should prompt the user to enter valid users
